You have several ways of doing this:
- Clone via HTTPS
- Clone via SSH
- Download via Github CLI
- Download the [zip package](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from the repository

We recommend HTTPS because it is the easiest to set up on the wild, and by users who are new to all this.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa.git
```

Although, we strongly recommend using an SSH connection when interacting with GitHub. If you are to this and are interested read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fleek-network/ursa.git
```
