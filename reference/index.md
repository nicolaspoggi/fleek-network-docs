This documentation is currently placeholder as the team prepares for an early testnet release around the month of August. Full documentation for references will arrive in due time, near the aforementioned testnet release. Current open source code is highly experimental and may be subject to change.

Our [Fleek Network](https://fleek.network) reference section will provide the reference materials for Fleek Network command-line interfaces (CLIs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing the resources.

A reference describes the instructions to interface with the system, it's broken down into commands or small pieces as a quick reference. This differs from our [Guides](guides) that take the pieces and put them together, instructing how and why youâ€™d use those parts.
