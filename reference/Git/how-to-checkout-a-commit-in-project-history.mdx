Change the directory to the Ursa directory in your file system:

```sh
cd <PATH-TO-URSA-CLI-PROJECT-SOURCE>
```

Pull the latest commits from `main` by:

```sh
git fetch origin main
```

ðŸ’¡ A git fetch gathers commits from the target branch that do not exist and stores them in your local repository. It doesn't merge them with your current branch for that use `git pull`.

```sh
git pull origin main
```

Once you have the latest target branch commits, checkout to any particular commit

```sh
git checkout <Commit hash>
```

A git commit hash is a SHA1 hash of the state of the git repository at the time of the [commit](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/commit/a7cfd35647ba4a3c7563a784870b8a806298bbc1). Here's an example:

```sh
a7cfd35647ba4a3c7563a784870b8a806298bbc1
```

If you open the Github repository UI, you'll find the commit hash on the right-hand side of the list, check the example [here](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/commits/main).

You can run the `git log` command on your local repository directory to find commit hashes.

```sh
git log --oneline
```

Here's an example of how that'd look like:

```sh
a7cfd35 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) feat: refined bootstrapping for testplan (#282)
bec6ee7 chore: revert debug trait (#281)
06b0d77 chore(service_tests.rs): remove redundant `mod tests` (#279)
850a15c Update pull_request_template.md (#280)
5ccf7d0 feat: advertise file size (#221)
4c6e505 feat: filter peers using cache summary for getbitswap (#274)
957ed5c feat: Use graphsync to pull data (#224)
3e1b41b chore: gateway doc (#269)
99edbb7 feat: send cache summary using request response (#268)
1c6464c feat: testplan data transfer (#267)
9e979ec feat: pull request + issue templates (#265)
```

Let's say that you are interested in checking out the commit `feat: Use graphsync to pull data`.

```sh
git checkout 957ed5c
```

ðŸ’¡ We can use the first few characters of the commit hash, valid as a short version that refers to `957ed5c92b5a9570cdadc821c571b19698aaf4db`.
