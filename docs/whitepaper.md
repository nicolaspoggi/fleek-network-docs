## Abstract

Fleek Network is a decentralized edge platform optimized to facilitate the deployment and running of performant web services (CDN, serverless functions, etc.). Fleek Network’s globally distributed and autonomously controlled network of edge nodes allows developers to frictionlessly create and utilize a multitude of edge services. These services inherit cryptographically and economically secured infrastructure, node and geographic coverage guarantees, stable and predictable costs, and consistent quality and performance across all services running on the network. Fleek Network’s goal is to provide a platform that all Web3 protocols, middleware, services, and applications can benefit from to further decentralize their stack without sacrificing cost, performance, complexity, or developer/end-user experience.
