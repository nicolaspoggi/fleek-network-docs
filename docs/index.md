In the past few months we expanded our initial CDN research into a full decentralized Edge Network. Most of that work is now done, and we have a new draft whitepaper and Github repo that we will release publicly this July, and a testnet for the decentralized edge network that will launch in August. [Read our milestone/roadmap update](https://blog.fleek.network/post/fleek-network-milestones-update/) for the full details. Expect updated documentation and node upgrade guides soon! Stay tuned to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleekxyz) for updates.
