Welcome to the **documentation for Fleek Network**, a decentralized edge platform optimized to facilitate the deployment and running of performant web services.

Fleek Networkâ€™s goal is to provide a platform based on a series of highly performant nodes that all Web3 protocols, middleware, services, and applications can benefit from, to further decentralize their stack without sacrificing cost, performance, complexity, or developer/end-user experience.
